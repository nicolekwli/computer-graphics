## Features:  
### (40s) all of...
- [x] OBJ loading (geometry and materials)
- [x] Wireframe rendering
- [x] Flat shaded rasterising
- [x] Moving camera (position only)
- [x] Saving of PPM files

### (50s) some of...
- [x] Changing camera orientation (via orientation matrix)
- [x] LookAt
* _Some form of generative geometry_
- [x] Ambient lighting
- [x] Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)


### (60s) some of...
* Hard Shadow
- [x] Gouraud shading
- [x] Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping
- [x] Simple animation (e.g. fly-through)
* _Some form of Physics (gravity, friction, bounce etc)_
- [x] Basic culling/clipping (far-plane, near-plan, back-face)
- [x] _Basic (image plane) anti-aliasing_ [wu line 2D]

### (70s) some of...
- [x] Phong Shading
- [x] Fairly “interesting” materials (e.g. mirrors)
- [x] Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing [attempted]
- [x] Perspective corrected texture mapping
* “Fancy” animation
* Soft shadow
* Bump maps
* Bounding box clipping [?? man im confused which is which]

### (80s) some of...
* Environment maps
* Complex “interesting” materials (e.g. glass)
- [x] Line drawing optimisations (e.g. Bresenham)
- [x] Advance clipping (frustum) [Need perfecting]
* Photon maps and caustics
* “Intelligent” model simplification
