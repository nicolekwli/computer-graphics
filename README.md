## Features:  
### (40s) all of...
- [x] OBJ loading (geometry and materials)
- [x] Wireframe rendering
- [x] Flat shaded rasterising
- [x] Moving camera (position only)
- [x] Saving of PPM files

### (50s) some of...
- [x] Changing camera orientation (via orientation matrix)
- [x] LookAt
* _Some form of generative geometry_
- [ ] Ambient lighting
- [ ] Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)


### (60s) some of...
* Hard Shadow
* Gouraud shading
- [x] Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping
* Simple animation (e.g. fly-through)
* _Some form of Physics (gravity, friction, bounce etc)_
- [x] Basic culling/clipping (far-plane, near-plan, back-face) [Need perfecting]
* _Basic (image plane) anti-aliasing_

### (70s) some of...
* Phong Shading
* Fairly “interesting” materials (e.g. mirrors)
* Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing
* Perspective corrected texture mapping
* “Fancy” animation
* Soft shadow
* Bump maps
* Bounding box clipping

### (80s) some of...
* Environment maps
* Complex “interesting” materials (e.g. glass)
- [x] Line drawing optimisations (e.g. Bresenham) [Need perfecting]
* Advance clipping (frustum)
* Photon maps and caustics
* “Intelligent” model simplification
