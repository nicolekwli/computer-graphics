## Features:  
### (40s) all of...
* ~~OBJ loading (geometry and materials)~~
* Wireframe rendering
* ~~Flat shaded rasterising~~
* Moving camera (position only)
* ~~Saving of PPM files~~

### (50s) some of...
* Changing camera orientation (via orientation matrix)
* LookAt
* _Some form of generative geometry_
* Ambient lighting
* Diffuse lighting (proximity and angle-of-incidence)


### (60s) some of...
* Hard Shadow
* Gouraud shading
* Naive (non-perspective corrected) texture mapping
* Simple animation (e.g. fly-through)
* _Some form of Physics (gravity, friction, bounce etc)_
* Basic culling/clipping (far-plane, near-plan, back-face)
* _Basic (image plane) anti-aliasing_

### (70s) some of...
* Phong Shading
* Fairly “interesting” materials (e.g. mirrors)
* Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing
* Perspective corrected texture mapping
* “Fancy” animation
* Soft shadow
* Bump maps
* Bounding box clipping

### (80s) some of...
* Environment maps
* Complex “interesting” materials (e.g. glass)
* Line drawing optimisations (e.g. Bresenham)
* Advance clipping (frustum)
* Photon maps and caustics
* “Intelligent” model simplification
